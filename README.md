# ESPHOME component to support Gree/Sinclair AC units
This repository will add support for ESP32-based WiFi modules to interface with Gree/Sinclair AC units.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

Work is still in progress!

Communication protocol is based on my own reverse-engineering.

ESPHome interface/binding based on:
* https://github.com/DomiStyle/esphome-panasonic-ac

**TODO**
* Support SENDING commands
* Support Timers
* Support Time sync
